<h3> Local ties and economic opportunities
</h3>
<p>
Economists emphasize that workers move across areas in search of opportunities for higher wages and lower costs of living. As workers follow economic opportunity, it smoothes differences across regions, and allows areas to recover from downturns. When workers move, however, they leave behind friends, family, and institutions like churches and local community groups. I propose to investigate differences in these local ties across regions and how they impact labor markets in different areas. I plan to use extensive data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics, which follows families over several decades, to quantify levels of local ties in different areas. By linking these local ties to labor market outcomes like wage levels, I can see how these impediments to mobility vary by area and by different types of workers.
