{"name":"Mike Zabek","tagline":"Mike Zabek PhD Candidate in Economics, University of Michigan","body":"### Mike Zabek\r\n\r\n\r\nI'm a PhD candidate at the University of Michigan working on topics in Labor, Urban, and Macroeconomics. I'm interested in the divergence of incomes in the United States over the past few decades, and topics relating to economic oportunities and outcomes more broadly. One topic that I'm exploring is how local connections bind people to areas, including areas in economic decline. If workers have ties to their home regions, then they will endure worse economic conditions without moving, which will prolong economic declines. If the people with the lowest levels of market skill stay in larger numbers it could lead to dysfunctional local finances. \r\n\r\n\r\n### History\r\n\r\nI'm originally from Vermont and I graduated in 2008 from Kenyon College. \r\n\r\nAfter College I worked as an RA at the [Consumer Payments Research Center](http://www.bostonfed.org/economic/cprc/index.htm) at the Boston Fed, where I help to develop a\r\nsurvey of consumer payments.\r\n\r\nAfter that, I worked for half a year with the [Abdul Latif Jameel\r\nPoverty Action La](http://www.povertyactionlab.org/south-asia) in Bihar, India. In India I was a Research\r\nAssociate, coordinating a Project Evaluations of two health programs\r\nfor several Economists. \r\n\r\nThen, in my final job before graduate school, I worked on the [Moving To\r\nOpportunity Final Impact Evaluation](http://www.nber.org/mtopublic/) at the NBER. Like my work at\r\nJPAL, I primarily looked at health outcomes.\r\n","google":"UA-57364435-1","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
