<h2>Mike Zabek<br />
</h2>
<p>
  I'm a PhD candidate at the University of
Michigan working on topics in Labor, Urban, and Macroeconomics. 
I'm interested in the divergence of incomes in the United States over the past few decades, and topics relating to economic oportunities and outcomes more broadly. 
One topic that I'm exploring is how local connections bind people to areas, including areas in economic decline. If workers have ties to their home regions, then they will endure worse economic conditions without moving, 
which will prolong economic declines. If the people with the lowest levels of market skill stay in larger numbers it could lead to dysfunctional local finances.  <br /> <br />

I'm originally from Vermont and I graduated in 2008 from Kenyon College. After College I worked as an RA at the <a href="http://www.bostonfed.org/economic/cprc/index.htm">Consumer
Payments Research Center</a> at the Boston Fed, where I help to develop a
survey of consumer payments. <br /> <br />
After that, I worked for half a year with the <a href="http://www.povertyactionlab.org/south-asia">Abdul Latif Jameel
Poverty Action Lab</a> in Bihar, India. In India I was a Research
Associate, coordinating a Project Evaluations of two health programs
for several Economists. You can check out one of
them <a href="http://www.povertyactionlab.org/evaluation/evaluating-impact-anemia-making-double-fortified-salt-available-bihar-india">here</a>. <br />
<br />
Then, in my final job before graduate school, I worked on the <a href="http://www.nber.org/mtopublic/">Moving To
Opportunity Final Impact Evaluation</a> at the NBER. Like my work at
JPAL, I primarily looked at health outcomes.
