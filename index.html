                      <p>We estimate the effects of personal income tax decreases on subjective financial well-being and consumer credit outcomes. A plausibly causal design shows that tax decreases in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act made survey respondents more likely to say they were ``living comfortably'' financially, with null effects at lower levels of subjective financial well-being. Estimates from a similar design using credit bureau data show that people who had larger tax decreases were modestly more likely to open new accounts, more likely to have higher consumer credit balances, and less likely to have a delinquency. Tax decreases had precisely estimated effects on credit scores that are indistinguishable from zero. Results suggest that tax decreases improve financial well-being in ways not fully proxied by expenditures.<p>

                      <p>Inequality in U.S. housing prices and rents both declined in the mid-20th century, even as home-ownership rates rose. Subsequently, housing-price inequality has risen to pre-War levels, while rent inequality has risen less. Combining both measures, we see inequality in housing consumption equivalents mirroring patterns in income across both space and time, according to an income elasticity of housing demand just below one. These patterns occur mainly within cities, and are not explained by observed changes in dwelling characteristics or locations. Instead, recent increases in housing inequality are driven most by changes in the relative value of locations, seen especially through land.<p>

                        <p> Someone who lives in an economically depressed place was probably born there. And having workers with local ties – who prefer to live in their birthplaces – leads to smaller migration responses in depressed places. Smaller migration responses lead to lower real incomes and make incomes more volatile, a form of hysteresis. Local ties can also persist for generations. Additionally, subsidies to economically depressed places cause smaller distortions, since few people want to move to depressed places. Finally, subsidies to productive places increase aggregate productivity, since they induce more migration.</p>

                                <p> Increases in labor force exits during the COVID-19 pandemic were larger for Black women, Latinas, and women living with children. After controlling for detailed job and demographic characteristics, we estimate larger increases in labor force exits among women living with children under age 6 and among lower-earning women living with school-age children. Women of color also had larger increases in labor force exits during the pandemic. A decomposition shows that differences in education and job characteristics explain a large portion of the racial differences in exits. The presence of children also predicted larger increases in exits during the pandemic among Latina and Black women. Overall, results suggest that childcare interruptions led to excess pandemic labor force exits with larger effects for women of color. </p>

                      The earnings of young adults who live in the same neighborhoods as their parents completely recover after a job displacement, unlike the earnings of young adults who live farther away, which permanently decline. Nearby workers appear to benefit from help with childcare since grandmothers are less likely to be employed after their child’s job displacement and since the earnings benefits are concentrated among young adults who have children. The result also suggests that parental employment networks improve earnings. Differences in job search durations, transfers of housing services, and geographic mobility, however, are too small to explain the result.

                      <h5>(With Brian Asquith and Andrew Samwich)</h5>
                      <p> We are interested in the effects of federal transfer programs, including AFDC, TANF, Medicaid, Unemployment Insurance, Medicare, and Social Security, on local economies in three areas. First is that we are interested in the effect of federal spending on local employment in terms of creating jobs due to the cash inflow and how these positive effects relate to the inherent disincentive effects of transfer spending on employment. Second, we are interested in understanding how much these social safety net programs act as a counter-cyclical stabilizer for local economies during acute downturns. Third, we are interested in the role of transfer programs in sectoral reallocations towards non-tradeable services. Effects of transfer programs are important both in terms of cross sectional differences across areas but also for understanding the implications of an aging population for the national economy. Our hope is that this research stream will create multiple papers focused on different related topics. <p>
